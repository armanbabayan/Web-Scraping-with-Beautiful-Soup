## Overview
Most of the cases in data science problems there is no ready data to use for training machine learning or deep learning models.
Manual data gathering is very expensive, time consuming, and difficult.
The Internet is a data store of the world's information - be it text, media or data in any other format. Most websites do not provide the option to save the data which they display to our local storage, or to our website. This is where Web Scraping can help us. The uses of Web Scraping for business as well as personal requirements are endless. In this repository is represented a simple example of web scraping with Beutiful Soup.
